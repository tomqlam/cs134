Included files:
lab1a.c: The source code for a program that modifies the default terminal behavior and if passed option --shell with argument of a shell command like bash or zsh, it runs the shell and acts like an interactive terminal. If no option is specified, it simply echoes terminal output. Passing in '^D' will kill the terminal process (if in --shell mode, waits for child to finish output).
Makefile: A file that builds the binary, cleans the directory, or tars everything into a distributable.
