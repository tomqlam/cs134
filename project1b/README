Included files:
lab1b-client.c: The source code for the client side of the assignment. This program should be run after server is run. Takes the following arguments:
    - compress (flag): Uses the zlib library to perform compression on any traffic it sends out and decompresses any traffic it receives through a socket connection.
    - log (takes argument): Writes the size of received and sent data and also the data itself to a log file that is specified as an argument; works with compress flag but data become unintelligible.
    - port (required, takes argument): The port number that the client uses (should be same as the server port).

lab1b-server.c: The source code for the server side of the assignment. This program should be run first. Takes the following arguments:
    - compress (flag): Uses the zlib library to perform compression on any traffic it sends out and decompresses any traffic it receives through a socket connection.
    - shell (takes argument): Path to shell program executable to be forked. The server forwards data received from the client to this shell program.
    - port (required, takes argument): The port number that the server listens on (should be the same as the client port).

Makefile: A file that builds the binaries for client and server, cleans the directory, or tars everything into a distributable.
